                <h2>General Information</h2>
                <p>The Mighty Ducks Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing 
                    Chicago's northside neighborhoods an environment in which to learn and play hockey. To be a 
                    member of MDHL, you must be between the ages of 4 - 12 and reside a Chicago northside neighborhood. MDHL ran by a small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of parents and previous league members.</p>
